## Overview
While on vacation in Hawaii, I have come up with a new business venture that will allow me live in Hawaii and explore my new found passion for surfing. I have put together a business plan for a Surf n' Shake shop. I have obtained the backing of investor W. Avy. I have run some analytics on weather statistics to investigate the average temperatures year-round. We are both satisfied with the data but W. Avy would like to know specifically the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Key differences in weather between June and December
- The average max temperature in June is approximately 75°F while the average max temperature in December is aproximately 71°F.

- June has weather that has less deviation with temperatures remaining in a tighter range. With the minimum at 64°F and the high at 85°F, there is only about a 20°F difference.
